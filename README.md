Building a Graph based on a random file with the Bag implementation and adjacency lists.

You have to read the data from the given file and then based on the GetMaxMinVertex class you will have all the edges and vertices of the data to create the graph.
Graph class uses dynamic lists and a dummy vertex which is important to create a Tree or a DFS tree based on the graph.

test1.txt is a random size file which contatins vertices and edges.
